# Google Homepage

This project was developed as part of the curriculum of The Odin Project. The result expected is a page similar to the Google search, not entirely functional, but visually similar.

This project is aimed to show my skills in HTML + CSS, like:
* Structuring a page in HTML.
* Creating semantic HTML.
* Defining the page layout through CSS.
